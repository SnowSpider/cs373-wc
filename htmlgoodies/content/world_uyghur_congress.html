<hr width="30%"/>
<p><font size="4">The World Uyghur Congress (WUC) is an international organisation that represents the collective interest of the Uyghur people both in East Turkestan and abroad. The WUC was established on 16 April 2004 in Munich, Germany, after the East Turkestan National Congress and the World Uyghur Youth Congress merged into one united organisation. The main objective of WUC is to promote the right of the Uyghur people to use peaceful, nonviolent, and democratic means to determine the political future of East Turkestan.

The WUC is a democratic organisation. All of WUC leadership was democratically elected by the participants from all over the world in the General Assembly. They all serve a three-year term. WUC has close contacts and working relations with most Uyghur organisations in the world that peacefully promote human rights, religious freedom, and democracy for the Uyghur people in East Turkestan.

On the First General Assembly of WUC in 2004 Mr. Erkin Alptekin was elected as president. He had lead WUC to its second General Assembly in 2006. Mr. Alptekin is a former general secretary of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) based in The Hague, the Netherlands. He has remarkable experience in working with international organisations and governments in lobbying for the Uyghur people’s right to self-determination. He is also a close friend of the Dalai Lama, spiritual leader of the Tibetan people.

On the Second General Assembly of the WUC, which took place in Munich from 24 – 27 November 2006, all delegates elected Ms. Rebiya Kadeer as the president of WUC.

The Third General Assembly of the WUC was convened in Washington, DC from 21 – 25 May 2009. Delegates and observers from Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Holland, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Norway, Sweden, Turkey and the United States attended the Assembly.

The Fouth General Assembly of the WUC was convened in Tokyo, Japan from 14 – 18 May 2012. Delegates and observers from Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Holland, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Norway, Sweden, Turkey and the United States attended the Assembly. Ms. Rebiya Kadeer, the leader of the international Uyghur human rights and democracy movement, was re-elected unanimously as the president of the WUC.

Before Rebiya Kadeer was elected as the president of WUC, she founded the “Uyghur Human Rights and Democracy Foundation” and headed the Uyghur American Association (UAA) based on Washington DC. She was also the winner of Rafto Prize and the nominee for 2005-2006-2007-2008-2009-2010-2011 Nobel Peace Prize. She spent nearly six years in Chinese prisons.
